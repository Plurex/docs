---

Plurex Protocols API is purpose-built for **account-agnostic execution intents**. It provides ergonomic message APIs that allow you to express your trading goals without getting bogged down by the micromanagement of execution.

Because our protocols are account and venue agnostic, they are built to scale—catering to everything from the simplest trading scenarios to full execution orchestration and risk management.

## Core Concepts

The Protocols API revolves around sending high-level intents that the Plurex engine translates into specific exchange actions. While we are starting with **Signal-based trading**, we will be expanding our protocol suite to include **Asset Baskets** and other sophisticated trading instruments in the future.

### Signal Protocol (Current)
Instead of managing individual orders, you send **Signal Messages**. These messages describe your desired state (e.g., "Open a Long on BTC-USD with 2% risk") rather than specific limit orders.

### Strategy Flexibility
The protocol supports various entry and exit strategies:

  <Tab title="Entries">
    Support for **Immediate** execution or **Market Trailing** confirmation to optimize your entry price.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Exits">
    Dynamic **Stop Loss** (Average Entry or Market Trailing) and multi-level **Take Profit** targets.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sizing">
    Flexible sizing models including **Fixed** percentage or **Risk-based** calculation.
  </Tab>
