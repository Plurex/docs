## Core Modules

The Platform API is structured around several key functional areas:

### Publishing Management
If you are a signal provider, the publishing module allows you to:
- **Define Subscription Plans**: Create tiers (e.g., Starter, Pro) with specific signal access and risk restrictions.
- **Manage Subscribers**: Dynamically add or remove users from plans using their Plurex handles.
- **Monitor Access**: Retrieve the current state of all plans and active subscriptions.

### Signals & Automation
The signals module provides visibility into your configured trading signals:
- **Signal Discovery**: Fetch headers and metadata for all your active signals.
- **Configuration Management**: (Upcoming) Programmatically update signal parameters and execution rules.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Platform API, you will need your API credentials which can be managed in your Plurex account settings.
